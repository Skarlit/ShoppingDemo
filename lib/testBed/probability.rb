The fifth edition of Statistics for the Behavioral and Social Sciences builds off an already well-established approach - emphasizing the intuitive, deemphasizing the mathematical, and explaining everything in direct, simple language - but also goes beyond these principles to further student understanding. By using definitional formulas to emphasize the concepts of statistics, rather than rote memorization, students work problems in a way that keeps them constantly aware of the underlying logic of what they are doing.

                    This book is a guide to the practical application of statistics to data analysis in the physical sciences. It is primarily addressed at students and professionals who need to draw quantitative conclusions from experimental data. Although most of the examples are taken from particle physics, the material is presented in a sufficiently general way as to be useful to people from most branches of the physical sciences. The first part of the book describes the basic tools of data analysis: concepts of probability and random variables, Monte Carlo techniques, statistical tests, and methods of parameter estimation. The last three chapters then develop more advanced statistical ideas, focusing on interval estimation, characteristic functions, and correcting distributions for the effects of measurement errors (unfolding).

                    The fourth edition of STATISTICS FOR SOCIAL DATA ANALYSIS continues to show students how to apply statistical methods to answer research questions in various fields. Throughout the text, the authors underscore the importance of formulating substantive hypotheses before attempting to analyze quantitative data. An important aspect of this text is its realistic, hands-on approach. Actual datasets are used in most examples, helping students understand and appreciate what goes into the research process. The book focuses on the continuous-discrete distinction in considering the level at which a variable is measured. Rather than dwelling on the four conventional levels-of-measurement distinctions, the authors discuss statistics for analyzing continuous and discrete variables separately and in combination.

Milton Keynes, U.K., in summer 1990.The workshop brought together about 30 world leaders in the use of advanced technologies in the teaching of mathematics and science.
The papers demonstrate how technology is impacting the view in the teaching profession of what should be taught, what can be taught, and how teachers should go about their work in the various disciplines. They offer great insight into the central issues of teaching and learning in a wide range of disciplines and across many grade levels, ranging from elementary school through college and undergraduate education.
The book has two major parts, on advanced technologies in the teaching of science and mathematics respectively,
although many of the papers address topics of interest to specialists in both areas. The papers reflect examples drawn from a wide range of fields, including mathematics, physics,
computer science, engineering, chemistry, and biology. Some demonstrate the use of software inteaching difficult but restricted concepts within a discipline. Other show an integrated approach that exploits the power of educational software throughout a course. The notions of discovery,
representation, qualitative models for reasoning, model building, and the management of complexity are key elements in numerous papers.

                    The use of statistics in biology, medicine, engineering, and the sciences has grown dramatically in recent years and having a basic background in the subject has become a near necessity for students and researchers in these fields. Although many introductory statistics books already exist, too often their focus leans towards theory and few help readers gain effective experience in using a standard statistical software package.
Designed to be used in a first course for graduate or upper-level undergraduate students, Basic Statistical Methods and Models builds a practical foundation in the use of statistical tools and imparts a clear understanding of their underlying assumptions and limitations. Without getting bogged down in proofs and derivations, thorough discussions help readers understand why the stated methods and results are reasonable. The use of the statistical software Minitab is integrated throughout the book, giving readers valuable experience with computer simulation and problem-solving techniques. The author focuses on applications and the models appropriate to each problem while emphasizing Monte Carlo methods, the Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals, and power functions.
The text assumes that readers have some degree of maturity in mathematics, but it does not require the use of calculus. This, along with its very clear explanations, generous number of exercises, and demonstrations of the extensive uses of statistics in diverse areas applications make Basic Statistical Methods and Models highly accessible to students in a wide range of disciplines.

                    The book provides a comprehensive treatment of the physics of hysteresis in magnetish, and of the mathematical tools used to describe it. The relations of hysteresis to Maxwell's equations, equilibrium and non equilibrium thermodynamics, non-linear system dynamics, micromagnetics and domain theory are discussed from a unified viewpoint. These aspects are then applied to the interpretation of magnetization reversal mechanisms: coherent rotation and switching in magnetic particles, stochastic domain wall motion and the Barkhausen effect, coercivity mechanisms and magnetic viscosity, rate-dependent hysteresis and eddy-current losses. Emphasis is given to the connection between basic physical ideas and phenomenological models of interest to applications, and, in particular, to the conceptual path going from Maxwell's equations abnd thermodynamics to micro-magnetics and to Preisach hysteresis modeling.
The reader will get insight into the importance and role of hysteresis in magnetism. In particular, he will learn:
* which are the fingerprints of hysteresis in magnetism
* which are the situations in which hysteresis may appear
* how to describe mathematically these situations
* how to apply these descriptions to magnetic materials
* how to interpret and predict magnetic hysteresis phenomena observed experimentally
The book is aimed at: (P) researchers and graduate students in physics, who are interested in magnetism and magnetic materials, and, more generally, in the physics of hysteresis phenomena, (P) materials scientists and engineers working on the development and application of magnetic materials, (S) mathematicians investigating the mathematical structure of hysteresis non-linearities.

Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata, Second Edition, fills this void, showing how to fit and interpret regression models for categorical data with Stata. The authors also provide a suite of commands for hypothesis testing and model diagnostics to accompany the book.
The book begins with an excellent introduction to Stata and then provides a general treatment of estimation, testing, fit, and interpretation in this class of models. It covers in detail binary, ordinal, nominal, and count outcomes in separate chapters. The final chapter discusses how to fit and interpret models with special characteristics, such as ordinal and nominal independent variables, interaction, and nonlinear terms. One appendix discusses the syntax of the author-written commands, and a second gives details of the datasets used by the authors in the book.
Nearly 50% longer than the previous edition, the book covers new topics for fitting and interpreting models included in Stata 9, such as multinomial probit models, the stereotype logistic model, and zero-truncated count models. Many of the interpretation techniques have been updated to include interval as well as point estimates.
New to the Second Edition:
Regression models, including the zero-truncated Poisson and the zero-truncated negative binomial models, the hurdle model for counts, the stereotype logistic regression model, the rank-ordered logit model, and the multinomial probit model
Stata commands, such as estat, which provides a uniform way to access statistics useful for postestimation interpretation.
Expanded suite of programs known as SPost
Inclusion of confidence intervals for predictions computed by prvalue and prgen

                    Chaos and complexity are the new buzz words in both science and contemporary society. The ideas they represent have enormous implications for the way we understand and engage with the world. Complexity Theory and the Social Sciences introduces students to the central ideas which surround the chaos/complexity theories. It discusses key concepts before using them as a way of investigating the nature of social research.
