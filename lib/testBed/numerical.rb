                    Undergraduates in engineering and the physical sciences receive a thorough introduction to perturbation theory in this useful and accessible text. Students discover methods for obtaining an approximate solution of a mathematical problem by exploiting the presence of a small, dimensionless parameter — the smaller the parameter, the more accurate the approximate solution. Knowledge of perturbation theory offers a twofold benefit: approximate solutions often reveal the exact solution's essential dependence on specified parameters; also, some problems resistant to numerical solutions may yield to perturbation methods. In fact, numerical and perturbation methods can be combined in a complementary way.
The text opens with a well-defined treatment of finding the roots of polynomials whose coefficients contain a small parameter. Proceeding to differential equations, the authors explain many techniques for handling perturbations that reorder the equations or involve an unbounded independent variable. Two disparate practical problems that can be solved efficiently with perturbation methods conclude the volume.
Written in an informal style that moves from specific examples to general principles, this elementary text emphasizes the \"why\" along with the \"how\"; prerequisites include a knowledge of one-variable calculus and ordinary differential equations. This newly revised second edition features an additional appendix concerning the approximate evaluation of integrals.

Kuehl uses a large array of real data sets from a broad spectrum of scientific and technological fields. This approach provides realistic settings for conducting actual research projects. Next, he emphasizes the importance of developing a treatment design based on a research hypothesis as an initial step, then developing an experimental or observational study design that facilitates efficient data collection. In addition to a consistent focus on research design, Kuehl offers an interpretation for each analysis.

                    This long-awaited Second Edition of Phillips and Taylor's highly successful text book provides a comprehensive introduction to numerical analysis. Over the two decades since the First Edition appeared there has been a dramatic explosion in computing power, from desk machine to personal computer, developments which have greatly enhanced the sheer fun of studying numerical analysis. The Second Edition builds on this, giving more emphasis to algorithms and encouraging their implementation on the pc.
This text book is not simply a 'recipe book' of numerical methods; it is one for serious students and researchers who want to understand the underlying theory, solve real numerical problems and write programs of their own.
