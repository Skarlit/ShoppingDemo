Many of the problems that engineers face involve randomly varying phenomena of one sort or another. However, if characterized properly, even such randomness and the resulting uncertainty are subject to rigorous mathematical analysis.
Taking into account the uniquely multidisciplinary demands of 21st-century science and engineering, Random Phenomena: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics for Engineers provides students with a working knowledge of how to solve engineering problems that involve randomly varying phenomena. Basing his approach on the principle of theoretical foundations before application, Dr. Ogunnaike presents a classroom-tested course of study that explains how to master and use probability and statistics appropriately to deal with uncertainty in standard problems and those that are new and unfamiliar.
Giving students the tools and confidence to formulate practical solutions to problems, this book offers many useful features, including:
Unique case studies to illustrate the fundamentals and applications of probability and foster understanding of the random variable and its distribution
Examples of development, selection, and analysis of probability models for specific random variables
Presentation of core concepts and ideas behind statistics and design of experiments
Selected \"special topics,\" including reliability and life testing, quality assurance and control, and multivariate analysis
As classic scientific boundaries continue to be restructured, the use of engineering is spilling over into more non-traditional areas, ranging from molecular biology to finance. This book emphasizes fundamentals and a \"first principles\" approach to deal with this evolution. It illustrates theory with practical examples and case studies, equipping readers to deal with a wide range of problems beyond those in the book.
About the Author:Professor Ogunnaike is Interim Dean of Engineering at the University of Delaware. He is the recipient of the 2008 American Automatic Control Council's Control Engineering Practice Award, the ISA's Donald P. Eckman Education Award, the Slocomb Excellence in Teaching Award, and was elected into the US National Academy of Engineering in 2012.

                    Undergraduates in engineering and the physical sciences receive a thorough introduction to perturbation theory in this useful and accessible text. Students discover methods for obtaining an approximate solution of a mathematical problem by exploiting the presence of a small, dimensionless parameter — the smaller the parameter, the more accurate the approximate solution. Knowledge of perturbation theory offers a twofold benefit: approximate solutions often reveal the exact solution's essential dependence on specified parameters; also, some problems resistant to numerical solutions may yield to perturbation methods. In fact, numerical and perturbation methods can be combined in a complementary way.
The text opens with a well-defined treatment of finding the roots of polynomials whose coefficients contain a small parameter. Proceeding to differential equations, the authors explain many techniques for handling perturbations that reorder the equations or involve an unbounded independent variable. Two disparate practical problems that can be solved efficiently with perturbation methods conclude the volume.
Written in an informal style that moves from specific examples to general principles, this elementary text emphasizes the \"why\" along with the \"how\"; prerequisites include a knowledge of one-variable calculus and ordinary differential equations. This newly revised second edition features an additional appendix concerning the approximate evaluation of integrals.

                    An accessible guide to developing intuition and skills for solving mathematical problems in the physical sciences and engineering
Equations play a central role in problem solving across various fields of study. Understanding what an equation means is an essential step toward forming an effective strategy to solve it, and it also lays the foundation for a more successful and fulfilling work experience. Thinking About Equations provides an accessible guide to developing an intuitive understanding of mathematical methods and, at the same time, presents a number of practical mathematical tools for successfully solving problems that arise in engineering and the physical sciences.
Equations form the basis for nearly all numerical solutions, and the authors illustrate how a firm understanding of problem solving can lead to improved strategies for computational approaches. Eight succinct chapters provide thorough topical coverage, including:
Approximation and estimation
Isolating important variables
Generalization and special cases
Dimensional analysis and scaling
Pictorial methods and graphical solutions
Symmetry to simplify equations
Each chapter contains a general discussion that is integrated with worked-out problems from various fields of study, including physics, engineering, applied mathematics, and physical chemistry. These examples illustrate the mathematical concepts and techniques that are frequently encountered when solving problems. To accelerate learning, the worked example problems are grouped by the equation-related concepts that they illustrate as opposed to subfields within science and mathematics, as in conventional treatments. In addition, each problem is accompanied by a comprehensive solution, explanation, and commentary, and numerous exercises at the end of each chapter provide an opportunity to test comprehension.
Requiring only a working knowledge of basic calculus and introductory physics, Thinking About Equations is an excellent supplement for courses in engineering and the physical sciences at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and educators in all branches of engineering, physics, chemistry, biophysics, and other related fields who encounter mathematical problems in their day-to-day work.

                    The standard latent class model. It has been popular among social scientists as an instrument for data reduction, as a flexible tool for analyzing structural relationships between categorical variables, and as a natural extension of the log-linear model in order to take measurement error into account. What, however, are the similarities and differences between the latent class model and latent trait models? Through a careful examination of these issues, author Ton Heinen explores such topics as how to estimate the parameters of latent class analysis models as well as the methods for model selection and ways to examine the correspondence between discrete latent trait models and certain restricted latent class models. In addition, he reviews log-linear models, latent trait models, and a number of restricted latent class models in detail as well as for the estimation of parameters for these models. Readers who would like to see how the estimation of the parameters in latent trait models plays a role in the correspondence between latent class and latent trait models will find Latent Class and Discrete Latent Trait Models a fascinating read.

                    This second edition of A Guided Tour of Mathematical Methods provides a comprehensive tour of the mathematical knowledge and techniques that are needed by students in this area. In contrast to more traditional textbooks, all the material is presented in the form of problems. Within these problems the basic mathematical theory and its physical applications are well integrated. The mathematical insights that the student acquires are therefore driven by their physical insight. Topics that are covered include vector calculus, linear algebra, Fourier analysis, scale analysis, complex integration, Green's functions, normal modes, tensor calculus, and perturbation theory. The second edition contains new chapters on dimensional analysis, variational calculus, and the asymptotic evaluation of integrals. This book can be used by undergraduates and lower-level graduate students in the physical sciences. It can serve as a stand-alone text, or as a source of problems and examples to complement other textbooks.

                    This monograph provides a self-contained and comprehensive account of the most significant existence results obtained over the
past two decades referring to some remarkable classes of ill-posed problems governed by non-accretive operators. All the results are derived from several compactness arguments, due mainly to the author, and are suitably illustrated by examples arising from various concrete problems - for example, nonlinear diffusion, heat conduction in materials with memory, fluid dynamics, and vibrations of a string with memory. Reference is made to optimal control theory in order to emphasize the degree of applicability of abstract compactness methods. Special attention is paid to multivalued perturbations of m-accretive operators; this case is analyzed under appropriate assumptions in order to allow the use of the general results in the study of some specific problems of great practical interest: reaction-diffusion and closed loop systems. Some biographical comments and open problems are also included. This new edition contains a number of improvements, corrections and insertions which both simplify and update the material. The book will be of interest to graduate students and specialists working in abstract evolution equations, partial differential equations, reaction-diffusion systems and ill-posed problems. A knowledge of topology, functional analysis and ordinary differential equations to undergraduate level is assumed.

The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of shastic integration and shastic calculus is developed, illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, which in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics. The book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of shastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time. The whole is backed by a large number of problems and exercises.

                    This text offers a rigorous introduction into the theory and methods of convergence spaces and gives concrete applications to the problems of functional analysis. While there are a few books dealing with convergence spaces and a great many on functional analysis, there are none with this particular focus.
The book demonstrates the applicability of convergence structures to functional analysis. Highlighted here is the role of continuous convergence, a convergence structure particularly appropriate to function spaces. It is shown to provide an excellent dual structure for both topological groups and topological vector spaces.
Readers will find the text rich in examples. Of interest, as well, are the many filter and ultrafilter proofs which often provide a fresh perspective on a well-known result.
Audience: This text will be of interest to researchers in functional analysis, analysis and topology as well as anyone already working with convergence spaces. It is appropriate for senior undergraduate or graduate level students with some background in analysis and topology.

The book and software provide an integrated and comprehensive combination of meta-analytic tools for the statistical integration of independent study results. Advanced BASIC Meta-Analysis has three distinct goals:
• to provide a clear and user-friendly introduction to the procedures and rules of effective meta-analytic integration;
• to present the implicit assumptions and strategies that guide successful meta-analytic integrations; and
• to develop a meta-analytic database management system that allows users to create, modify, and update a database, including the relevant statistical information and predictors, for a given research domain.
The companion software system allows users to perform a full complement of meta-analytic statistical functions with the speed and flexibility of a database management system. It can also construct a wide array of meta-analytic graphic displays. This text and software package serves as a useful introduction to the quantitative assessment of research domains for those new to meta-analyses. It is also a valuable sourcebook for those who have already conducted meta-analyses.

                    This text describes how fractal phenomena, both deterministic and random, change over time, using the fractional calculus. The intent is to identify those characteristics of complex physical phenomena that require fractional derivatives or fractional integrals to describe how the process changes over time. The discussion emphasizes the properties of physical phenomena whose evolution is best described using the fractional calculus, such as systems with long-range spatial interactions or long-time memory.
In many cases, classic analytic function theory cannot serve for modeling complex phenomena; \"Fractal Operators\" shows how classes of less familiar functions, such as fractals, can serve as useful models in such cases. Because fractal functions, such as the Weierstrass function (long known not to have a derivative), do in fact have fractional derivatives, they can be cast as solutions to fractional differential equations. The traditional techniques for solving differential equations, including Fourier and Laplace transforms as well as Green's functions, can be generalized to fractional derivatives.
Fractal Operators addresses a general strategy for understanding wave propagation through random media, the nonlinear response of complex materials, and the fluctuations of various forms of transport in heterogeneous materials. This strategy builds on traditional approaches and explains why the historical techniques fail as phenomena become more and more complicated.

The author investigates, among others, hypoelliptic, parabolic, elliptic and Schrödinger equations, and boundary value problems arising in applications. In particular, results are given about completeness of the set of Floquet solutions, Floquet expansions of arbitrary solutions, the distribution of Floquet exponents and quasimomentums, the solvability of nonhomogeneous equations, the existence of decreasing or bounded solutions, and the structure of the spectrum of periodic operators. Many of the results discussed here have been available only in research papers until now. The role of the Floquet-Lyapunov theory for ordinary differential equations is well known, but for partial differential equations an analog of this theory has been developed only recently. This theory is of great importance for the quantum theory of solids, the theory of wave guides, scattering theory and other fields of mathematical and theoretical physics.

A new chapter on the applications of shastic methods in finance provides an introduction to this field using the same simple kind of language as the other parts of the book. This chapter also includes an introduction to Lévy processes, which have found to be very useful in simulating financial systems where more accuracy is required than is available from simple Brownian motion models. New material is also provided on the approach to the white noise limit, on the applications of Poisson representation methods to population dynamics, and on several other applications of shastic methods.

                    Although twistor theory originated as an approach to the unification of quantum theory and general relativity, twistor correspondences and their generalizations have provided powerful mathematical tools for studying problems in differential geometry, nonlinear equations, and representation theory. At the same time, the theory continues to offer promising new insights into the nature of quantum theory and gravitation.
Further Advances in Twistor Theory, Volume III: Curved Twistor Spaces is actually the fourth in a series of books compiling articles from Twistor Newsletter-a somewhat informal journal published periodically by the Oxford research group of Roger Penrose. Motivated both by questions in differential geometry and by the quest to find a twistor correspondence for general Ricci-flat space times, this volume explores deformed twistor spaces and their applications.
Articles from the world's leading researchers in this field-including Roger Penrose-have been written in an informal, easy-to-read style and arranged in four chapters, each supplemented by a detailed introduction. Collectively, they trace the development of the twistor programme over the last 20 years and provide an overview of its recent advances and current status.

                    Are there other dimensions beyond our own? Is time travel possible? Can we change the past? Are there gateways to parallel universes? All of us have pondered such questions, but there was a time when scientists dismissed these notions as outlandish speculations. Not any more. Today, they are the focus of the most intense scientific activity in recent memory. In Hyperspace, Michio Kaku, author of the widely acclaimed Beyond Einstein and a leading theoretical physicist, offers the first book-length tour of the most exciting (and perhaps most bizarre) work in modern physics, work which includes research on the tenth dimension, time warps, black holes, and multiple universes. The theory of hyperspace (or higher dimensional space) - and its newest wrinkle, superstring theory - stand at the center of this revolution, with adherents in every major research laboratory in the world, including several Nobel laureates. Beginning where Hawking's Brief History of Time left off, Kaku paints a vivid portrayal of the breakthroughs now rocking the physics establishment. Why all the excitement? As the author points out, for over half a century, scientists have puzzled over why the basic forces of the cosmos - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces - require markedly different mathematical descriptions. But if we see these forces as vibrations in a higher dimensional space, their field equations suddenly fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, perfectly snug, in an elegant, astonishingly simple form. This may thus be our leading candidate for the Theory of Everything. If so, it would be the crowning achievement of 2,000 years of scientific investigation into matter and its forces. Already, the theory has inspired several thousand research papers, and has been the focus of over 200 international conferences. Many leading scientists believe the theory will unlock the deepest secrets of creation and answer some of the most intriguing questions of all

                        Kaku, a physicist, paints a vivid portrait of the groundbreaking theory of hyperspace and its newest wrinkle--superstring theory.

                    The Completeness of Scientific Theories deals with the role of theories in measurement. Theories are employed in measurements in order to account for the operation of the instruments and to correct the raw data obtained. These observation theories thus guarantee the reliability of measurement procedures. In special cases a theory can be used as its own observation theory. In such cases it is possible, relying on the theory itself, to analyze the measuring procedures associated with theoretical states specified within its framework. This feature is called completeness. The book addresses the assets and liabilities of theories exhibiting this feature.
 Chief among the prima-facie liabilities is a testability problem. If a theory that is supposed to explain certain measurement results at the same time provides the theoretical means necessary for obtaining these results, the threat of circularity arises. Closer investigation reveals that various circularity problems do indeed emerge in complete theories, but that these problems can generally be solved. Some methods for testing and confirming theories are developed and discussed.
 The particulars of complete theories are addressed using a variety of theories from the physical sciences and psychology as examples. The example developed in greatest detail is general relativity theory, which exhibits an outstanding degree of completeness. In this context a new approach to the issue of the conventionality of physical geometry is pursued.
 The book contains the first systematic analysis of completeness; it thus opens up new paths of research.
 For philosophers of science working on problems of confirmation, theory-ladenness of evidence, empirical testability, and space—time philosophy (or students in these areas).

                    This text provides an introduction to the theory of convex polytopes and polyhedral sets, to algebraic geometry and to the fascinating connections between these fields: the theory of toric varieties (or torus embeddings).
The fist part of the book contains an introduction to the theory of polytopes - one of the most important parts of classical geometry in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Since the discussion here is independent of any applications to algebraic geometry, it would also be suitable for a course in geometry. This part also provides large parts of the mathematical background of linear optimization and of the geometrical aspects in Computer Science. The second part introduces toric varieties in an elementary way, building on the concepts of combinatorial geometry introduced in the first part. Many of the general concepts of algebraic geometry arise in this treatment and can be dealt with concretely. This part of the book can thus serve for a one-semester introduction to algebraic geometry, with the first part serving as a reference for combinatorial geometry.

The next chapters, which will also interest physicists, include treatments of the quantum mechanics of the electron, electromagnetism and special relativity. A new classification of spinors is introduced, based on bilinear covariants of physical observables. This reveals a new class of spinors, residing among the Weyl, Majorana and Dirac spinors. Scalar products of spinors are categorized by involutory anti-automorphisms of Clifford algebras. This leads to the chessboard of automorphism groups of scalar products of spinors. On the algebraic side, Brauer/Wall groups and Witt rings are discussed, and on the analytic, Cauchy's integral formula is generalized to higher dimensions.

                    Undergraduates in engineering and the physical sciences receive a thorough introduction to perturbation theory in this useful and accessible text. Students discover methods for obtaining an approximate solution of a mathematical problem by exploiting the presence of a small, dimensionless parameter — the smaller the parameter, the more accurate the approximate solution. Knowledge of perturbation theory offers a twofold benefit: approximate solutions often reveal the exact solution's essential dependence on specified parameters; also, some problems resistant to numerical solutions may yield to perturbation methods. In fact, numerical and perturbation methods can be combined in a complementary way.
The text opens with a well-defined treatment of finding the roots of polynomials whose coefficients contain a small parameter. Proceeding to differential equations, the authors explain many techniques for handling perturbations that reorder the equations or involve an unbounded independent variable. Two disparate practical problems that can be solved efficiently with perturbation methods conclude the volume.
Written in an informal style that moves from specific examples to general principles, this elementary text emphasizes the \"why\" along with the \"how\"; prerequisites include a knowledge of one-variable calculus and ordinary differential equations. This newly revised second edition features an additional appendix concerning the approximate evaluation of integrals.

                    Robert Kuehl's DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS, Second Edition, prepares students to design and analyze experiments that will help them succeed in the real world. Kuehl uses a large array of real data sets from a broad spectrum of scientific and technological fields. This approach provides realistic settings for conducting actual research projects. Next, he emphasizes the importance of developing a treatment design based on a research hypothesis as an initial step, then developing an experimental or observational study design that facilitates efficient data collection. In addition to a consistent focus on research design, Kuehl offers an interpretation for each analysis.

                    This long-awaited Second Edition of Phillips and Taylor's highly successful text book provides a comprehensive introduction to numerical analysis. Over the two decades since the First Edition appeared there has been a dramatic explosion in computing power, from desk machine to personal computer, developments which have greatly enhanced the sheer fun of studying numerical analysis. The Second Edition builds on this, giving more emphasis to algorithms and encouraging their implementation on the pc.
This text book is not simply a 'recipe book' of numerical methods; it is one for serious students and researchers who want to understand the underlying theory, solve real numerical problems and write programs of their own.

Throughout the text, the authors underscore the importance of formulating substantive hypotheses before attempting to analyze quantitative data. An important aspect of this text is its realistic, hands-on approach. Actual datasets are used in most examples, helping students understand and appreciate what goes into the research process. The book focuses on the continuous-discrete distinction in considering the level at which a variable is measured. Rather than dwelling on the four conventional levels-of-measurement distinctions, the authors discuss statistics for analyzing continuous and discrete variables separately and in combination.

Milton Keynes, U.K., in summer 1990.The workshop brought together about 30 world leaders in the use of advanced technologies in the teaching of mathematics and science.
The papers demonstrate how technology is impacting the view in the teaching profession of what should be taught, what can be taught, and how teachers should go about their work in the various disciplines. They offer great insight into the central issues of teaching and learning in a wide range of disciplines and across many grade levels, ranging from elementary school through college and undergraduate education.
The book has two major parts, on advanced technologies in the teaching of science and mathematics respectively,
although many of the papers address topics of interest to specialists in both areas. The papers reflect examples drawn from a wide range of fields, including mathematics, physics,
computer science, engineering, chemistry, and biology. Some demonstrate the use of software inteaching difficult but restricted concepts within a discipline. Other show an integrated approach that exploits the power of educational software throughout a course. The notions of discovery,

                    If you're not sure what to make of all the claims and counterclaims, this new book will help cut through the conflicting reports and contradictory findings.
We are bombarded daily with media reports of startling new findings from \"just released\" studies often in major, authoritative publications on consumer products, medications, foods, alcohol, safety devices, social behavior, public policy, and much more. The decisions of millions of consumers, professionals, and government agencies can be influenced by just one study.
Light, humorous, and entertaining, Studies Show reviews sample studies to expose their traps and pitfalls. In plain English, statistics analyst John H. Fennick discusses the methods of good and bad studies to explain how scientific results can differ sometimes radically. Fennick shows that when armed with common sense and critical intelligence, we can understand almost any study.

                    The use of statistics in biology, medicine, engineering, and the sciences has grown dramatically in recent years and having a basic background in the subject has become a near necessity for students and researchers in these fields. Although many introductory statistics books already exist, too often their focus leans towards theory and few help readers gain effective experience in using a standard statistical software package.
Designed to be used in a first course for graduate or upper-level undergraduate students, Basic Statistical Methods and Models builds a practical foundation in the use of statistical tools and imparts a clear understanding of their underlying assumptions and limitations. Without getting bogged down in proofs and derivations, thorough discussions help readers understand why the stated methods and results are reasonable. The use of the statistical software Minitab is integrated throughout the book, giving readers valuable experience with computer simulation and problem-solving techniques. The author focuses on applications and the models appropriate to each problem while emphasizing Monte Carlo methods, the Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals, and power functions.
The text assumes that readers have some degree of maturity in mathematics, but it does not require the use of calculus. This, along with its very clear explanations, generous number of exercises, and demonstrations of the extensive uses of statistics in diverse areas applications make Basic Statistical Methods and Models highly accessible to students in a wide range of disciplines.

                    The book provides a comprehensive treatment of the physics of hysteresis in magnetish, and of the mathematical tools used to describe it. The relations of hysteresis to Maxwell's equations, equilibrium and non equilibrium thermodynamics, non-linear system dynamics, micromagnetics and domain theory are discussed from a unified viewpoint. These aspects are then applied to the interpretation of magnetization reversal mechanisms: coherent rotation and switching in magnetic particles, stochastic domain wall motion and the Barkhausen effect, coercivity mechanisms and magnetic viscosity, rate-dependent hysteresis and eddy-current losses. Emphasis is given to the connection between basic physical ideas and phenomenological models of interest to applications, and, in particular, to the conceptual path going from Maxwell's equations abnd thermodynamics to micro-magnetics and to Preisach hysteresis modeling.
The reader will get insight into the importance and role of hysteresis in magnetism. In particular, he will learn:
* which are the fingerprints of hysteresis in magnetism
* which are the situations in which hysteresis may appear
* how to describe mathematically these situations
* how to apply these descriptions to magnetic materials
* how to interpret and predict magnetic hysteresis phenomena observed experimentally
The book is aimed at: (P) researchers and graduate students in physics, who are interested in magnetism and magnetic materials, and, more generally, in the physics of hysteresis phenomena, (P) materials scientists and engineers working on the development and application of magnetic materials, (S) mathematicians investigating the mathematical structure of hysteresis non-linearities.

                    Although regression models for categorical dependent variables are common, few texts explain how to interpret such models. Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata, Second Edition, fills this void, showing how to fit and interpret regression models for categorical data with Stata. The authors also provide a suite of commands for hypothesis testing and model diagnostics to accompany the book.
The book begins with an excellent introduction to Stata and then provides a general treatment of estimation, testing, fit, and interpretation in this class of models. It covers in detail binary, ordinal, nominal, and count outcomes in separate chapters. The final chapter discusses how to fit and interpret models with special characteristics, such as ordinal and nominal independent variables, interaction, and nonlinear terms. One appendix discusses the syntax of the author-written commands, and a second gives details of the datasets used by the authors in the book.
Nearly 50% longer than the previous edition, the book covers new topics for fitting and interpreting models included in Stata 9, such as multinomial probit models, the stereotype logistic model, and zero-truncated count models. Many of the interpretation techniques have been updated to include interval as well as point estimates.
New to the Second Edition:
Regression models, including the zero-truncated Poisson and the zero-truncated negative binomial models, the hurdle model for counts, the stereotype logistic regression model, the rank-ordered logit model, and the multinomial probit model
Stata commands, such as estat, which provides a uniform way to access statistics useful for postestimation interpretation.
Expanded suite of programs known as SPost
Inclusion of confidence intervals for predictions computed by prvalue and prgen
Because all the examples, datasets, and author-written commands are available from the authors' Web site, readers can easily replicate the concrete examples using Stata, making it ideal for students or applied researchers who want to know how to fit and interpret models for categorical data.
